Could not find image processor class in the image processor config or the model config. Loading based on pattern matching with the model's feature extractor configuration.
Some weights of the model checkpoint at microsoft/trocr-small-handwritten were not used when initializing SinusoidalVisionEncoderDecoder: ['decoder.model.decoder.embed_positions.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing SinusoidalVisionEncoderDecoder from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing SinusoidalVisionEncoderDecoder from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of SinusoidalVisionEncoderDecoder were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/trocr-small-handwritten and are newly initialized: ['encoder.pooler.dense.weight', 'decoder.model.decoder.embed_positions._float_tensor', 'encoder.pooler.dense.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
