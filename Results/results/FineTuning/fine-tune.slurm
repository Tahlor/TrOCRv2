Could not find image processor class in the image processor config or the model config. Loading based on pattern matching with the model's feature extractor configuration.
Some weights of VisionEncoderDecoderModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/trocr-small-stage1 and are newly initialized: ['encoder.pooler.dense.bias', 'encoder.pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
